# Logging-page
Create a vibrant and interactive login page for a futuristic virtual reality gaming platform called "Neon Nexus." The page should feature a sleek design with neon colors and dynamic animations to captivate users. Incorporate HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. Include a visually striking login form with fields for username and password, accompanied by glowing neon buttons for logging in and signing up. Implement animations such as pulsating neon lights, sliding transitions, and hover effects to enhance user engagement. Additionally, integrate JavaScript functionality to validate user input, provide real-time feedback, and seamlessly transition between login and signup modes. The goal is to immerse users in the electrifying world of Neon Nexus from the moment they land on the login page.
